Passphrase card generator


This is a flask app that will allow for the generation of a card with words to use as a passwords. Your creativity on how to use the card is on you.

The words are all stored in the output.txt file. There is 26,000 words in that file ranging from 3 to 9 characters with no duplicates. Any bigger and it would take forever to load.

I will put the word list generator up on another project later.
